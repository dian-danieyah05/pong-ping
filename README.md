#[üêç] Snake Game 
The snake game is a classic arcade-style game where a player controls a snake that grows in length as it consumes food pellets, increasing the challenge as the snake becomes longer. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the playing area. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible by strategically maneuvering the snake to eat as much food as possible without crashing.
