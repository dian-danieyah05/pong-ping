Tetris is a classic puzzle video game where players must arrange falling blocks of various shapes, called tetrominoes, to create and clear complete horizontal lines on the game board. 
As the game progresses, the tetrominoes fall faster, increasing the challenge. 
The game ends when the stacked blocks reach the top of the screen, preventing any more tetrominoes from entering.
